# NeuroForge: Modular Neural Network Construction Toolkit

NeuroForge is a TypeScript-based toolkit designed to facilitate the rapid prototyping and deployment of custom neural network architectures. It provides a flexible and modular system for defining layers, managing connections, and executing training workflows, catering to both research and production environments.

This repository houses the core NeuroForge library, offering a robust foundation for building diverse neural network models. It abstracts away much of the boilerplate code typically associated with deep learning frameworks, allowing developers to focus on the architectural nuances of their specific problems. NeuroForge prioritizes composability and extensibility, enabling users to easily integrate custom layers, loss functions, and optimization algorithms. The library is built with performance in mind, leveraging efficient matrix operations and optimized data structures to ensure fast training and inference times. By providing a streamlined and intuitive API, NeuroForge empowers developers to explore innovative network designs and accelerate the development lifecycle of their machine learning applications. It aims to bridge the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation, offering a powerful tool for both experienced practitioners and those new to the field of neural networks.

The core philosophy of NeuroForge revolves around modularity and reusability. Each component, from individual neurons to complete network layers, is designed as a self-contained module that can be easily combined and customized. This approach promotes code organization, simplifies debugging, and facilitates the creation of complex architectures from simpler building blocks. NeuroForge also provides comprehensive support for data pre-processing and post-processing, including utilities for data normalization, feature extraction, and result visualization. This integrated approach streamlines the entire machine learning pipeline, from data ingestion to model deployment. Furthermore, NeuroForge includes a built-in testing framework that allows developers to rigorously validate their network architectures and ensure their correctness.

NeuroForge is not just a library; it's a platform for innovation. It's designed to be easily extensible, allowing developers to create custom layers, loss functions, and optimization algorithms. The library also provides a flexible API for integrating with other machine learning tools and frameworks. NeuroForge is more than just a collection of pre-built components; it's a framework for building your own custom neural network solutions.

## Key Features

*   **Modular Layer Design:** Define custom layers using a simple and intuitive API. Each layer is a self-contained module with its own forward and backward pass implementations. This promotes code reusability and simplifies the creation of complex architectures. (Implementation uses abstract classes and interfaces for flexible extension).
*   **Dynamic Network Construction:** Build networks dynamically at runtime, allowing for flexible experimentation with different architectures. The network topology can be modified on the fly, enabling the creation of adaptive and evolving models. (Leverages TypeScript's type system for strong typing and error prevention).
*   **Automatic Differentiation:** Utilizes automatic differentiation to compute gradients for backpropagation. This eliminates the need to manually derive gradients for each layer, simplifying the development process. (Implementation based on a computational graph representation of the network).
*   **Optimized Matrix Operations:** Leverages optimized matrix operations for fast training and inference. The library uses efficient algorithms and data structures to minimize computational overhead. (Utilizes a custom matrix library optimized for neural network operations).
*   **Built-in Visualization Tools:** Visualize network architecture, training progress, and model performance. This provides valuable insights into the behavior of the network and helps identify potential issues. (Uses charting libraries to display training curves and other relevant metrics).
*   **Customizable Loss Functions:** Define custom loss functions to tailor the training process to specific tasks. The library provides a flexible API for defining and implementing different loss functions. (Uses functional programming principles for defining loss function calculations).
*   **Flexible Optimizer Integration:** Easily integrate different optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent, Adam, and RMSprop. The library provides a unified interface for configuring and using various optimizers. (Uses an abstraction layer to decouple the network from the specific optimization algorithm).

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** The core language used for building the library. TypeScript's strong typing and object-oriented features promote code quality and maintainability.
*   **Node.js:** Used for running the development environment, building the library, and executing tests.
*   **npm/yarn:** Package managers for managing dependencies and building the project.
*   **A Custom Matrix Library:** A dedicated matrix library crafted for optimal performance within the neural network environment. This avoids dependency on heavier, general-purpose libraries. (Focuses on SIMD instructions and memory alignment for speed).
*   **A Visualization Library (e.g., Chart.js, D3.js):** Used for creating visualizations of network architecture, training progress, and model performance (Can be easily swapped out via configuration).

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js (version 16 or higher) and npm or yarn installed on your system.

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/NeuroForge.git
    cd NeuroForge

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    npm install
    or
    yarn install

4.  **Build the library:**
    npm run build
    or
    yarn build

## Configuration

NeuroForge utilizes environment variables for configuring certain aspects of its behavior. These variables can be set in a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.

Example `.env` file:



*   `NODE_ENV`: Specifies the environment (development, production, test).
*   `LEARNING_RATE`: The learning rate for the optimization algorithm.
*   `BATCH_SIZE`: The batch size for training.

These configurations can also be passed directly within the code when initializing components like the optimizer. Environment variables provide a convenient way to manage global settings, while direct configuration offers granular control over specific instances.

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to create and train a simple neural network using NeuroForge:

Example:

class CustomLayer {
// Implements the Layer interface
}

const network = new Network([
new DenseLayer(10, Activation.ReLU),
new DenseLayer(5, Activation.Sigmoid),
new DenseLayer(1, Activation.Sigmoid)
]);

const optimizer = new AdamOptimizer({ learningRate: 0.001 });
const lossFunction = new MeanSquaredError();

network.train(trainingData, labels, optimizer, lossFunction, { epochs: 100 });

(Full API documentation and more detailed examples will be provided in a separate document or a dedicated website. The API will cover layer creation, network construction, training procedures, and evaluation metrics.)
