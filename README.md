# NeuroForge: Evolving Neuro-Symbolic Architectures for Compositional Generalization

Fusing differentiable reasoning with knowledge graph embeddings via transformer-based inference.

## Detailed Description

NeuroForge is a cutting-edge research project focused on developing and evolving neuro-symbolic architectures capable of robust compositional generalization. This is achieved by seamlessly integrating differentiable reasoning mechanisms with knowledge graph embeddings, enabling the system to learn and reason over structured knowledge in a manner that transcends simple pattern matching. The core objective is to create a system that can understand and respond to novel combinations of known concepts, a critical capability for artificial intelligence in real-world scenarios.

The project leverages transformer-based inference to mediate between the symbolic and neural components. This allows for contextualized interpretation of knowledge graph relationships and guides the differentiable reasoning process. By learning embeddings of knowledge graph entities and relations, NeuroForge can efficiently represent semantic information and reason about implicit connections. The system is designed to be adaptable, with the architectural components evolving through a combination of reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms to optimize performance on specific compositional generalization tasks.

NeuroForge aims to address the limitations of purely neural or purely symbolic approaches. Neural networks excel at pattern recognition but struggle with systematic generalization. Symbolic systems, while strong in logical inference, often lack the robustness and adaptability of neural networks. By combining these paradigms, NeuroForge strives to achieve a synergistic effect, leveraging the strengths of both approaches to create a more powerful and versatile AI system. This research has significant implications for areas such as natural language understanding, question answering, and robot control.

## Key Features

*   **Differentiable Reasoning Engine:** Implements a custom differentiable logic programming language, allowing for gradient-based optimization of reasoning rules and inference processes. This enables the system to learn effective reasoning strategies directly from data. The engine supports forward and backward chaining, as well as a novel form of constraint satisfaction.
*   **Knowledge Graph Embedding Module:** Utilizes advanced knowledge graph embedding techniques, such as RotatE and DistMult, to represent entities and relations in a low-dimensional vector space. These embeddings are then used as input to the transformer-based inference module, enabling the system to reason about relationships between concepts. Implemented using PyTorch Geometric.
*   **Transformer-Based Inference:** Employs a custom-designed transformer architecture specifically tailored for neuro-symbolic integration. This architecture mediates between the knowledge graph embeddings and the differentiable reasoning engine, allowing the system to reason about relationships between concepts in a contextualized manner. The attention mechanism is crucial for identifying relevant information in the knowledge graph.
*   **Evolving Architecture:** Incorporates reinforcement learning and evolutionary algorithms to automatically optimize the architecture of the neuro-symbolic system. This allows the system to adapt to different tasks and environments, improving its overall performance and generalization capabilities. The evolution targets both the neural network architecture and the symbolic rules.
*   **TypeScript Implementation:** The core logic of the system, including the differentiable reasoning engine and the transformer-based inference module, is implemented in TypeScript, ensuring type safety and maintainability. This allows for easy integration with other JavaScript-based technologies and facilitates development of web-based interfaces.
*   **Compositional Generalization Benchmark:** Includes a suite of benchmark tasks designed to evaluate the compositional generalization capabilities of the system. These tasks cover a range of domains, including logical reasoning, program synthesis, and natural language understanding.

## Technology Stack

*   **TypeScript:** The primary programming language for the core logic, offering type safety and maintainability. TypeScript interfaces define the interactions between the neural and symbolic components.
*   **Node.js:** The runtime environment for executing the TypeScript code. Node.js provides a robust and scalable platform for running the system.
*   **PyTorch:** Used for the knowledge graph embedding module and potentially for supporting neural network components within the differentiable reasoning engine. PyTorch offers a powerful and flexible framework for deep learning.
*   **PyTorch Geometric:** A library for implementing graph neural networks, used for the knowledge graph embedding module.
*   **Jest:** A testing framework for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the TypeScript code.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    git clone https://github.com/jjfhwang/NeuroForge.git
    cd NeuroForge

2.  **Install Node.js and npm:**

    Ensure that Node.js (version 16 or higher) and npm are installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website.

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    npm install

4.  **Install Python Dependencies**

    The Knowledge Graph Embedding Module and Reinforcement Learning components rely on Python. We recommend using `conda` for dependency management.

    

## Configuration

NeuroForge utilizes environment variables for configuration. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and define the following variables:

*   `KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_PATH`: The path to the knowledge graph file (e.g., `data/knowledge_graph.json`).
*   `EMBEDDING_DIMENSION`: The dimensionality of the knowledge graph embeddings (e.g., `128`).
*   `LEARNING_RATE`: The learning rate for the differentiable reasoning engine (e.g., `0.001`).
*   `REINFORCEMENT_LEARNING_ALGORITHM`: The algorithm used for evolving the architecture (e.g., `PPO`).

You can load these environment variables using a library such as `dotenv`.

## Usage

To run the system, execute the following command:



This will start the main NeuroForge application.

Example API usage (if applicable):

The NeuroForge system exposes a set of APIs for interacting with the differentiable reasoning engine and the knowledge graph embedding module. For example, you can use the `reason` API to perform logical inference:
